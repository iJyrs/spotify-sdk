An open-source, unofficial SDK package for developers looking to integrate the Spotify Web API with their Node.js applications.

⚠️ This project is still under heavy development! Use at your own risk. ⚠️

*There are going to be missing features & bugs,* please open an [Issue]() and I will get to it eventually.

# Installation / Prerequisites

You can install the package via `npm install @ijyrs/spotify-webapi`.

To access Spotify's Web API, you must create a application, you can find the link [here]().

# Documentation

*Coming soon.* **Should** be available once the library reaches v1.0.0 or when mostly completed.
